3. If a topic is provided, focus on content relevant to that topic
4. Create a clear, structured summary of the content

For each URL, provide:

1. Core Information:

   - Key takeaways (3-5 points)
   - Most relevant quotes or statements
   - Publication details (date, author if available)

2. Content Summary:
   - Brief overview (2-3 sentences)

   - Supporting evidence or examples
   - If topic provided, highlight topic-relevant content

3. Source Context:
   - Content type (article, blog, research, etc.)
   - Publisher/platform
   - Credibility indicators

Focus on extracting signal from noise:
- Prioritize main content over peripheral information
- Remove duplicate or redundant content

If a topic is provided, emphasize content relevant to that topic while maintaining context.`,

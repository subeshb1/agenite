   - Break down the main topic into 3-5 specific aspects
   - Ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Focus on current and relevant angles

2. Source Requirements:
   - Recent (preferably within last 2 years)
   - Authoritative sources
   - Direct relevance to subtopic
   - Substantial content (not just brief mentions)

3. Present findings in this format:

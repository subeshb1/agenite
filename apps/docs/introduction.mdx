## What is Agenite?

Agenite (pronounced as Agen-ite) is a powerful TypeScript framework designed for building sophisticated AI agents. It provides a modular, type-safe, and flexible architecture that makes it easy to create, compose, and control AI agents with advanced capabilities.

### Key features

- **Type safety**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript, ensuring robust type checking and excellent developer experience
- **Tool integration**: First-class support for creating and using tools with built-in schema validation
- **Provider agnostic**: Seamless integration with multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, and Ollama
- **Streaming support**: Real-time streaming of agent responses and tool executions
- **State management**: Built-in state management with custom reducers for maintaining conversation context
- **Multi-agent architecture**: Support for creating complex agent hierarchies and delegating tasks
- **Middleware system**: Flexible middleware system for customizing agent behavior
- **Token tracking**: Built-in token usage monitoring and optimization

## Core concepts

### Agents

Agents are the central building blocks in Agenite. An agent:
- Orchestrates interactions between LLMs and tools
- Manages conversation state and context
- Handles tool execution and results
- Supports nested execution for complex workflows
- Provides streaming capabilities for real-time interactions

### Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities by providing specific functionalities:
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- JSON Schema validation for inputs
- Flexible error handling
- Easy API integration
- Zero dependencies in core implementation

### Providers

LLM providers handle the actual language model interactions:
- Support for major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock)
- Local model support via Ollama
- Consistent interface across providers
- Easy extension for new providers

### Execution flow

Agenite uses a step-based execution model:
1. LLM call - Process input and determine actions
2. Tool call - Execute required tools
3. Tool result - Process tool execution results
4. Agent call - Handle nested agent executions

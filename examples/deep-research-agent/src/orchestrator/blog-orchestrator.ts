1. INPUT: You receive a research query
2. PROCESS:
   - Use web_search to find relevant sources about the topic
   - For each source found:
     * Extract key information like company details, products, team, market position
     * Note any unique insights or data points
     * Identify areas needing deeper research
   - Format the results as JSON with:

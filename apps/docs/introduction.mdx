## What is Agenite?

Agenite is a powerful TypeScript framework designed for building sophisticated AI agents. It provides a modular, type-safe, and flexible architecture that makes it easy to create, compose, and control AI agents with advanced capabilities.

<Note>
The name Agenite (pronounced as Agen-ite) comes from combining "Agent" with the suffix "-ite", representing a framework that crystallizes best practices for building AI agents.

## Core concepts

### Agents

Agents are the central building blocks in Agenite. An agent:
- Orchestrates interactions between LLMs and tools
- Manages conversation state and context
- Handles tool execution and results
- Supports nested execution for complex workflows
- Provides streaming capabilities for real-time interactions

### Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities by providing specific functionalities:
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- JSON Schema validation for inputs
- Flexible error handling
- Easy API integration

### Providers

Currently supported LLM providers:
- AWS Bedrock with Claude models
- Local models via Ollama
- Consistent interface for easy provider switching
- Built-in streaming support
